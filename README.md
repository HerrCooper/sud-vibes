# Sudoku Game - iPad App

This folder contains the iPad-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) version of the Sudoku game.

## How to Install on iPad

### Method 1: Progressive Web App (Recommended - No App Store needed)

1. **Host the files:**
   - Upload all files from the `ipad-app` folder to a web server
   - You can use services like:
     - GitHub Pages (free)
     - Netlify (free)
     - Vercel (free)
     - Your own web hosting

2. **Open on iPad:**
   - Open Safari on your iPad
   - Navigate to your hosted URL (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/sudoku)

3. **Add to Home Screen:**
   - Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
   - Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
   - Tap "Add" in the top right
   - The app icon will appear on your home screen

4. **Play:**
   - Tap the icon to launch the full-screen app
   - Works offline after first load!

### Method 2: Using GitHub Pages (Free Hosting)

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one)

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Name it something like "sudoku-game"
   - Make it public

3. **Upload files:**
   - Upload all files from the `ipad-app` folder to the repository
   - Make sure to include icon files (see below)

4. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Click Save

5. **Access your app:**
   - Your app will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/sudoku-game`
   - Follow Method 1 steps 2-4 to install on iPad

## Icon Files Needed

You need to create two icon files (or use placeholder images):

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

You can:
1. Create custom icons using an image editor
2. Use online icon generators
3. Use simple colored squares as placeholders

## Files Included

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with iPad optimizations
- `styles.css` - All styles (same as desktop version)
- `sudoku.js` - Game logic (same as desktop version)
- `manifest.json` - PWA configuration
- `service-worker.js` - Offline functionality

## Features

- ✅ Full-screen app experience
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ✅ Saves to iPad home screen
- ✅ No App Store approval needed
- ✅ All game features (themes, number systems, notes, stats)
- ✅ Touch-optimized controls
- ✅ Responsive design for iPad

## Alternative: Native App Options

If you want a true native app in the App Store:

1. **Use Cordova/PhoneGap:**
   - Wraps the web app in a native container
   - Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year)

2. **Use React Native/Flutter:**
   - Rebuild the app as a native app
   - More complex but better performance

3. **Use AppGyver/Adalo:**
   - No-code platforms that can package web apps
   - Some have free tiers

## Troubleshooting

**App doesn't install:**
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome)
- Check that all files are properly hosted
- Verify manifest.json is accessible

**App doesn't work offline:**
- Make sure service-worker.js is in the same folder
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clearing cache and reinstalling

**Touch controls don't work:**
- All controls should work with touch
- Caps Lock detection won't work on iPad (use Notes button instead)
